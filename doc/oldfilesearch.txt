USING OLDFILESEARCH                                      *using-oldfilesearch*

OldFileSearch defines one command: ':Oldfiles'. This command will read in the
|v:oldfile| list, filter out some types of files (configurable as defined
below), and display them as:
	filename.ext || ~/path/to/file
Select a file by putting the cursor anywhere on its line, and open it by
hitting:
	<CR>: open in current window
	s:    open in new horizontal split (below)
	t:    open in new tab
	v:    open in new vertical split (right)

Other keymappings in the old file list buffer are:
    d:    delete file from the old file list (in .viminfo)
	q:    close the old file list buffer
	/:    search and filter the old file list.

A bit more explanation on searching: Hitting `/` brings up a `search>` prompt
in the command line, and lines in the old file list will be filtered in real
time as you type. Standard Vim regex can be used, and words separated by spaces
must all occur in the same line (either filename or path), in any order. While
searching, hitting <CR> will end the search, keeping the filtered list, whereas
hitting <ESC> will end, restoring the previous, unfiltered list.

Note that filtering is preserved in the undo list. This includes filtering for
filetypes as defined below. Hence, hitting `u` will undo these filtering
steps.
